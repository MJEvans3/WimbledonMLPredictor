## 📊 Code Structure & Key Components

### 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
```python
# Load historical ATP match data
all_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(data_path, "atp_matches_*.csv"))
df = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(f) for f in all_files], ignore_index=True)

# Clean and prepare data
df = df[["tourney_date", "surface", "winner_name", "loser_name",
         "winner_rank", "loser_rank", "winner_age", "loser_age",
         "winner_ht", "loser_ht"]].dropna()
```

### 2. Dynamic ELO Rating System
```python
# Initialize rating systems
elo = defaultdict(lambda: 1500)  # General ELO
surface_elo = defaultdict(lambda: {"Hard": 1500, "Clay": 1500, "Grass": 1500})

# Update after each match
exp = 1/(1+10**((e_l - e_w)/400))
elo[winner] += K*(1-exp)
elo[loser] -= K*(1-exp)
```

### 3. Feature Generation Engine
```python
def generate_match_features(player1, player2, surface="Grass"):
    features = [
        p1_elo - p2_elo,                    # ELO difference
        p1_surf_elo - p2_surf_elo,          # Surface ELO difference
        player2["rank"] - player1["rank"],  # Rank difference (inverted)
        h2h_pct,                            # Head-to-head percentage
        player1["age"] - player2["age"],    # Age difference
        player1["height"] - player2["height"], # Height difference
        p1_recent - p2_recent,              # Recent form difference
        rest_days_diff                      # Rest advantage
    ]
    return features
```

### 4. Tournament Simulation
```python
def simulate_match(player1, player2, model):
    features = generate_match_features(player1, player2)
    prob_p1_wins = model.predict_proba([features])[0][1]
    return player1 if prob_p1_wins > 0.5 else player2

def simulate_tournament(players, model):
    while len(players) > 1:
        winners = []
        for i in range(0, len(players), 2):
            winner = simulate_match(players[i], players[i+1], model)
            winners.append(winner)
        players = winners
    return players[0]  # Champion
```
